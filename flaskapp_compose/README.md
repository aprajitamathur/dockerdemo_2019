Docker Compose 
We will be creating a basic multi-service application. We will add a simple redis hit counter with our flask app

In the app.py we have added a simple hit_number function. 
Clone the repo and run docker-compose up -d, you should see an image be created and the application attempt to start. 
If we open the app at http://localhost:5000
